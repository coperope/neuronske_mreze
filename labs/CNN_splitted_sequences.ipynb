Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n","3/3 [==============================] - 1s 216ms/step\n","PRECISION: 0.7288888888888889\n","RECALL: 0.2213225371120108\n","F1: 0.33954451345755693\n","--------------------\n","tp: 820\n","tn: 34438\n","fp: 305\n","fn: 2885\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","2\n","89\n","2\n","89\n","PRECISION: 0.7288888888888889\n","RECALL: 0.2213225371120108\n","F1: 0.33954451345755693\n","--------------------\n","tp: 820\n","tn: 34438\n","fp: 305\n","fn: 2885\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Accuracy: 0.7384370015948963\n","Segment based metrics\n","========================================\n","  Evaluated length                  : 587.48 sec\n","  Evaluated files                   : 89 \n","  Segment length                    : 1.00 sec\n","\n","  Overall metrics (micro-average)\n","  ======================================\n","  F-measure\n","    F-measure (F1)                  : 55.68 %\n","    Precision                       : 79.84 %\n","    Recall                          : 42.74 %\n","  Error rate\n","    Error rate (ER)                 : 0.68 \n","    Substitution rate               : 0.00 \n","    Deletion rate                   : 0.57 \n","    Insertion rate                  : 0.11 \n","  Accuracy\n","    Sensitivity                     : 42.74 %\n","    Specificity                     : 93.26 %\n","    Balanced accuracy               : 68.00 %\n","    Accuracy                        : 73.84 %\n","\n","  Class-wise average metrics (macro-average)\n","  ======================================\n","  F-measure\n","    F-measure (F1)                  : 55.68 %\n","    Precision                       : 79.84 %\n","    Recall                          : 42.74 %\n","  Error rate\n","    Error rate (ER)                 : 0.68 \n","    Deletion rate                   : 0.57 \n","    Insertion rate                  : 0.11 \n","  Accuracy\n","    Sensitivity                     : 42.74 %\n","    Specificity                     : 93.26 %\n","    Balanced accuracy               : 68.00 %\n","    Accuracy                        : 73.84 %\n","  \n","\n","  Class-wise metrics\n","  ======================================\n","    Event label  | Nref    Nsys  | F        Pre      Rec    | ER       Del      Ins    | Sens     Spec     Bacc     Acc     \n","    ------------ | -----   ----- | ------   ------   ------ | ------   ------   ------ | ------   ------   ------   ------  \n","    Dishes       | 241     129   | 55.7%    79.8%    42.7%  | 0.68     0.57     0.11   | 42.7%    93.3%    68.0%    73.8%   \n","\n","\n","Event based metrics (onset-offset)\n","========================================\n","  Evaluated length                  : 543.38 sec\n","  Evaluated files                   : 89 \n","  Evaluate onset                    : True \n","  Evaluate offset                   : True \n","  T collar                          : 250.00 ms\n","  Offset (length)                   : 50.00 %\n","\n","  Overall metrics (micro-average)\n","  ======================================\n","  F-measure\n","    F-measure (F1)                  : 36.30 %\n","    Precision                       : 43.97 %\n","    Recall                          : 30.91 %\n","  Error rate\n","    Error rate (ER)                 : 1.08 \n","    Substitution rate               : 0.00 \n","    Deletion rate                   : 0.69 \n","    Insertion rate                  : 0.39 \n","\n","  Class-wise average metrics (macro-average)\n","  ======================================\n","  F-measure\n","    F-measure (F1)                  : 36.30 %\n","    Precision                       : 43.97 %\n","    Recall                          : 30.91 %\n","  Error rate\n","    Error rate (ER)                 : 1.08 \n","    Deletion rate                   : 0.69 \n","    Insertion rate                  : 0.39 \n","  \n","\n","  Class-wise metrics\n","  ======================================\n","    Event label  | Nref    Nsys  | F        Pre      Rec    | ER       Del      Ins    |\n","    ------------ | -----   ----- | ------   ------   ------ | ------   ------   ------ |\n","    Dishes       | 165     116   | 36.3%    44.0%    30.9%  | 1.08     0.69     0.39   |\n","\n","\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","4 ------ Dog 319\n","WARNING:tensorflow:5 out of the last 12 calls to <function Model.make_predict_function.<locals>.predict_function at 0x7ff73a50e3b0> triggered tf.function retracing.
